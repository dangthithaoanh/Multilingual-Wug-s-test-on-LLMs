# Multilingual-Wug-s-test-on-LLMs

This repository consists of the code and data from the paper Morphology Matters: Probing the Cross-linguistic Morphological Generalization Abilities of Large Language Models through a Wug Test presented at the Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics Workshop (CMCL) at ACL 2024

The `translation` folder contains the translation of the Wug test (Berko, 1958) in six languages (i.e., German, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Romanian, and Vietnamese).

The `statistical analysis` folder consists of the data and R script for the statistical analysis.

At the home directory is the Python script used for translating the Wug test using GPT-4 and for running the experiment.
