# Multilingual-Wug-test-on-LLMs

This repository consists of the code and data from the paper Morphology Matters: **Probing the Cross-linguistic Morphological Generalization Abilities of Large Language Models through a Wug Test** presented at the *Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics Workshop (CMCL)* at ACL 2024

The `translations` folder contains the translations of the Wug test by Jean Berko Gleason in six languages (i.e., German, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Romanian, and Vietnamese).

The `statistical analysis` folder consists of the data and R script for the statistical analysis.

The `plonllms.py` at the home directory is the Python script used for translating the Wug test using GPT-4 and for running the experiment.
